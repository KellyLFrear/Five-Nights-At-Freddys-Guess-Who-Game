# Five-Nights-At-Freddys-Guess-Who-Game
NOT FINISHED!! Inspired By MrWigglesworth's FNAF Guess Who Series on Youtube! :)  

My plan is to create a silly guess who game to practice some Unity!! :)) And to also practice my own graphic design in an 8-Bit art style (since that's my art style for the buttons I'm making for this game.
